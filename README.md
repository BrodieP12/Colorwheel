# Colorwheel

In file "Get Color at XY.py" you input an x and a y value and it returns an r, g, b tuple from the pixel location in the image "gamut.png", I took the main "make_color" function from the file named "color picker test.py"
My goal is to be able to either insert an r, g, b tuple or a decimal color input of the parameters but havent figured it out yet.
This is for a future drawing project in pygame where eventually will become a full costume maker like in scratch.
